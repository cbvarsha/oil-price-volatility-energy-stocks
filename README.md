# Oil Price Volatility & Energy Stocks Analysis

End-to-end financial data science project analysing oil prices, energy stocks,
market sentiment, and machine learning–based trading strategies (2019–2025).

---

## Project Overview
This project studies how changes in oil prices (Brent & WTI) affect major
energy stocks (XOM, CVX, BP, Shell) and the broader market (SPY). It combines
SQL analytics, Python data analysis, NLP sentiment modelling, and machine
learning–based strategy evaluation.

## Project Flow
1. Data collection from Yahoo Finance and news RSS feeds
2. SQL-based statistical and correlation analysis
3. Data cleaning and feature engineering
4. Time-series and volatility analysis
5. News sentiment analysis using NLP
6. Machine learning modelling and strategy backtesting

- SQL (correlations, aggregations, calendar effects)
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- NLP (VADER, TextBlob)
- Machine Learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM)
- Time-series cross-validation
- Risk-adjusted performance evaluation
